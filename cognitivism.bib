Vincent Descombes brings together an astonishingly large body of philosophical and anthropological thought to present a thoroughgoing critique of contemporary cognitivism and to develop a powerful new philosophy of the mind.
\\
Beginning with a critical examination of American cognitivism and French structuralism, Descombes launches a more general critique of all philosophies that view the mind in strictly causal terms and suppose that the brain--and not the person--thinks. Providing a broad historical perspective, Descombes draws surprising links between cognitivism and earlier anthropological projects, such as Lévi-Strauss's work on the symbolic status of myths. He identifies as incoherent both the belief that mental states are detached from the world and the idea that states of mind are brain states; these assumptions beg the question of the relation between mind and brain.
\\
In place of cognitivism, Descombes offers an anthropologically based theory of mind that emphasizes the mind's collective nature. Drawing on Wittgenstein, he maintains that mental acts are properly attributed to the person, not the brain, and that states of mind, far from being detached from the world, require a historical and cultural context for their very intelligibility.
\\
Available in English for the first time, this is the most outstanding work of one of France's finest contemporary philosophers. It provides a much-needed link between the continental and Anglo-American traditions, and its impact will extend beyond philosophy to anthropology, psychology, critical theory, and French studies.},

Still dependent on basic assumptions of Cartesian philosophy, Cognitive Science took over the mistakes of classical computational models. Instead of being treated as mere or pure explanations of mental processes with hindsight, these models were mistakenly used as more or less literal causal descriptions of the (working of the) mind. A clear insight into the relevance of embodied and embedded knowledge is not only a central topic in {AI} research; it can become a driving force for a reassessment of philosophy. Philosophy, which is struggling with the two opposite alternatives of cultural relativism and rationalism, both of which have turned out to be dead ends, is in need of a reassessment of reasoning. What is needed is a reasoning without reference to ultimate reasons which at the same time is grounded (and doesn’t fall into the trap of cultural relativism).},

This has led to a rethinking of psychology as the study of discursive practices, including the semantics of working vocabularies and the rules governing orderly thought and action. This has an affinity with analytical philosophy. At the same time it suggests a reinterpretation of older psychological research. First-order experiments study psychological phenomena, but second-order experiments, now very common, study how people describe imaginary situations, and their reactions to them, so that it is essentially a study of discursive practices. Wittgenstein’s use of the word ‘grammar’ suggests a convenient term for clusters of working rules. Philosophers have identified similar clusters of propositions, as a priori but synthetic propositions, expressing principles of order imposed on raw material by human beings. Psychologists have identified contingent universals which have such an ordering function. The revelation of the historical and cultural variability of such grammars opens up the possibility of richer self-understanding and of the repatterning of life systems.},

After post-cognitivism, research in these areas can contribute both to scholarly understanding of cognition, and to the emerging discipline of {CA.}},

	abstract = {Existential phenomenologists hold that the two most basic forms of intelligent behavior, learning, and skillful action, can be described and explained without recourse to mind or brain representations. This claim is expressed in two central notions in Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology of Perception : the intentional arc and the tendency to achieve a maximal grip . The intentional arc names the tight connection between body and world, such that, as the active body acquires skills, those skills are “stored”, not as representations in the mind, but as dispositions to respond to the solicitations of situations in the world. A phenomenology of skill acquisition confirms that, as one acquires expertise, the acquired know-how is experienced as finer and finer discriminations of situations paired with the appropriate response to each. Maximal grip names the body's tendency to refine its responses so as to bring the current situation closer to an optimal gestalt. Thus, successful learning and action do not require propositional mental representations. They do not require semantically interpretable brain representations either.},

Now {GOFAI} has failed, and Rondey Brooks boasts that his animats avoid the frame problem precisely by directly relating to the world. But Brook’s animates and all other versions of what some call Heideggerian {AI} have their own version of the frame problem, viz. that the program can’t update relevance. Fortunately, there is at least one model of how the brain could provide the causal basis of such an ability. Walter Freeman, a founding figure in neurodynamics and one of the first to take seriously the idea of the brain as a nonlinear dynamical system, has worked out an account of how the brain of an active animal can directly pick up and update what counts as significant in its world. But, to program Heideggerian {AI}, we would not only need a model of brain functioning such as Freeman’s; we would also need a model of our particular way of being embedded and embodied such that what we experience is significant for us in the particular way that it is. This shows the task of a Heideggerian {AI} to be overwhelmingly difficult and casts doubt on whether we will ever be able to accomplish it.},
