	abstract = {This paper discusses whether and how cultural context can be used in studies using conversation analysis {(CA)} and ethnomethodology {(EM).} I start with inspecting {CA} and {EM} principles regarding the use of (cultural) context. There is a risk of treating participants as ‘puppets’ of socio-cultural forces, and contextual features should only be taken into account if observably relevant for specific interactions. However, I argue that {CA} is overly cautious in attending to cultural particulars, in part because identifying universal conversational ‘rules’ has become its end-goal. In the second empirical part I discuss how, in interviews about infertility in Malawi, participants make relevant the cultural context. Examination of the sequential context of references to the cultural setting demonstrates their interactional function. Thus, respondents actively build Malawi's cultural context in situ, for the purposes at hand. I conclude that, notwithstanding {CA's} and discursive psychology's dispreference for interviews, using such data is an appropriate way to remedy analysts’ lack of cultural knowledge, as cultural particulars are brought to bear ‘there and then’. Moreover, if {CA} shifts its focus from universal turn-taking procedures to cultural particulars, it revives {EM's} interest in ‘ethnomethods’: reasoning and accounting practices, shared by members of collectivities.},

	abstract = {In a period given to emphasizing diversity among humans, we would do well to explore diversity among forms of discourse and among forms of talk-in-interaction in particular. Among the speech-exchange systems, ordinary conversation has been claimed to be distinctive and fundamental, but questions have been raised about both claims. The resources for discriminating among speech-exchange systems are located in such generic organizations of practice as turn-taking, sequence organization, the organization of repair and the overall structural organization of episodes of interaction. I try to show that `conversation' as a distinctive speech-exchange system is real and is not only a residual category, and that it is to be understood as the `basic' speech-exchange system, in part by reference to the distinctive turn-taking organization (among others) through which it is implemented. The `motivation' for having developed a formal account of this turn-taking organization is recounted, and that formal account is defended for its usability in the analytic explication of singular, contexted episodes of talk. The remainder of the article is given over to such an exemplary account - an examination of an episode of interaction during a testing session between a man whose brain hemispheres had been surgically separated and a researcher.},

It is largely through conversation that the major institutions of our society - economy, religion, politics, family and law - are implemented. This is the first in a new series of books by Emanuel Schegloff introducing the findings and theories of conversation analysis. Together, the volumes in the series when published will constitute a complete and authoritative 'primer' in the subject. The topic of this first volume is 'sequence organization' - the ways in which turns-at-talk are ordered and combined to make actions take place in conversation, such as requests, offers, complaints, and announcements. Containing many examples from real-life conversations, it will be invaluable to anyone interested in human interaction and the workings of conversation.},
