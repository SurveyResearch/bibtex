	title = {Talk and Interaction in Social Research Methods},
	abstract = {This book admirably fulfils its stated objective of describing social research methods in action and exploring, from a range of perspectives, the linguistic shaping of social context. Overall, this is a balanced, well-edited and coherent collection of papers, bringing together high quality work from recognized authorities in the analysis of talk-in-interaction. It is also highly accessible; it would certainly make an excellent resource book for undergraduate, graduate (and practising!) social scientists ' - Rebecca Clift, University of Essex  {'Talk} and Interaction in Social Research Methodologies is a much-needed methods text. Focusing on research methods in action, the volume offers a new way of viewing the realities of social research. By taking language use seriously, the text reveals the details and depths of a wide range of research projects as they have seldom been presented before.   This is the first book of its kind to offer such a powerful and insightful depiction of the role of talk-in-interaction in relation to social research methods. The book's plan is creative and unparalleled. There's nothing else like it. The editors-Paul Drew, Geoffrey Raymond and Darin Weinberg-represent the very best from multiple traditions of researching talk-in-interaction-from both sides of the Atlantic. The chapters are written by a sterling collection of researchers-a virtual honor roll of conversation analysts and kindred spirits.   This book is a "must read" for social researchers of all disciplines who are interested in social interaction. It should be assigned reading for all graduate students being introduced to qualitative methods. It should be on every qualitative researcher's book shelf. It is a tour de force in demonstrating the absolutely fundamental position that language use holds in social science methodology' - James A Holstein, Marquette University  This is a methodology text with a difference. It demonstrates the importance of talk in a variety of social research methodologies. Even documents, the seemingly least interactional form of social data, are shown to have important interactional dimensions. The book focuses systematically on how sociological methods are essentially conducted through forms of spoken interaction, and how these interactions shape the results that emerge in research. The book demonstrates:  " How spoken interactions shape the outcomes of core research methodologies " The role which talk-in-interaction plays in key substantive areas of sociology notably race, crime, gender and media " Reveals the interactional underpinnings of research methodologies  This is the first text aimed at an undergraduate and Master's audience in Sociology and Social Research, which shows the crucial part that spoken interaction plays in the conduct and products of conventional sociological methodologies.},

Central notions in a dialogical account of talk-in-interaction are those of ‘communicative project’ and ‘communicative activity type’. This implies a dynamic interpretation of what ‘organisation(s) in discourse’ are about.},
