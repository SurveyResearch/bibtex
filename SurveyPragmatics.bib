	abstract = {In this paper we provide a model of interviewer–respondent interaction in survey interviews. Our model is primarily focused on the occurrence of problems within this interaction that seem likely to affect data quality. Both conversational principles and cognitive processes, especially where they do not match the requirements of the respondent's task, are assumed to affect the course of interactions. The cognitive processes involved in answering a survey question are usually described by means of four steps: interpretation, retrieval, judgement and formatting. Each of these steps may be responsible for different overt problems, such as requests for clarification or inadequate answers. Such problems are likely to affect the course of the interaction through conversational principles which may cause, for example, suggestive behaviour on the part of the interviewer, which may in turn yield new problematic behaviours. However, the respondent may not be the only one who experiences cognitive problems; the interviewer may also have such problems, for example with respect to explaining question meaning to the respondent. Thus the model proposed here, unlike most of the other models which concentrate on the respondent, tries to incorporate cognitive processes and conversational principles with respect to both interviewer and respondent. In particular, the model looks at how cognitive processes and conversational principles affect both the interaction between interview participants and the quality of the eventual answers.

	abstract = {In this paper, we take issue with the belief--desire model of second- and third-person action interpretation as it is presented by both theory theories and cognitivist versions of simulation theory. These accounts take action interpretation to consist in the (tacit) attribution of proper belief--desire pairs that mirror the structure of formally valid practical inferences. We argue that the belief--desire model rests on the unwarranted assumption that the interpreter can only reach the agent's practical context of action through inference. This assumption betrays a deep-seated bias toward disengaged, observational interpretation strategies. On our alternative picture, the interpreter can start off on the assumption of a shared practical context and proceed to reason discourse in those cases in which this assumption runs aground. Following Brandom's non-formalist account of reason discourse, we suggest that interpreting other people's actions in terms of reasons is not a matter of following the principles of formally valid practical syllogisms, but of endorsing practical material inferences that are correct in virtue of a shared practical world.

This study compared four pretesting methods using a single questionnaire in repeated trials of each. The four methods were conventional pretests, behavior coding, cognitive interviews, and expert panels. We developed a model-based coding scheme that classified problems as respondent-semantic, respondent-task, interviewer-task, or analysis. On average, expert panels were most productive in the number of problems identified. Conventional pretesting and behavior coding were the only methods to identify significant numbers of interviewer problems. By contrast, expert panels and cognitive interviews were the only methods to diagnose a nontrivial number of analysis problems. Expert panels and behavior coding were more consistent than the other methods in the numbers of problems identified across trials, as well as in their distribution of problem types. From the vantage point of the particular problems identified, behavior coding was the most reliable method. Costs of the conventional pretests and behavior coding were about the same, cognitive interviews were somewhat less expensive, and expert panels were considerably cheaper.},

I give an example from the recording of the ‘cognitions’ of a person with a learning disability, and try to show how they are shaped by institutional requirements as to what is to count as recordable in the circumstances. {‘In} the circumstances’ is an analyst’s stance: for the members involved, the cognitions are rock-solid discoveries, and will remain so until challenged.},

Westerners tend to engage in context-independent and analytic perceptual processes by focusing on a salient object independently of its context, whereas Asians tend to engage in context-dependent and holistic perceptual processes by attending to the relationship between the object and the context in which the object is located. Recent research has explored mechanisms underlying such cultural differences, which indicate that participating in different social practices leads to both chronic as well as temporary shifts in perception. These findings establish a dynamic relationship between the cultural context and perceptual processes. We suggest that perception can no longer be regarded as consisting of processes that are universal across all people at all times.},

Accordingly, academic accounts of the import of conversational `texts' can be endogenously grounded, and this is a worthy analytic aspiration; (2) The pursuit of this goal mandates relevant senses of context to be consulted for analysis, and these are senses and aspects of context which are demonstrably relevant to the participants in the event being examined, not necessarily ones relevant to the inquirer doing the analysis; and (3) Its technical grounds and mandate aside, this is a useful contraint on analysis in disciplining work to the indigenous preoccupations of the everyday world being grasped, and serving as a buffer against the potential for academic and theoretical imperialism which imposes intellectuals' preoccupations on a world without respect to their indigenous resonance.},
