	%isbn = {9780199583904},
	abstract = {How should religion and ethics be studied if we want to understand what people believe and why they act the way they do? In the 1980s and '90s postmodernist worries about led to debates that turned on power, truth, and relativism. Since the turn of the century scholars impressed by 'cognitive science' have introduced concepts drawn from evolutionary biology, neurosciences, and linguistics in the attempt to provide 'naturalist' accounts of religion. Deploying concepts andarguments that have their roots in the pragmatism of C. S. Peirce, Believing and Acting argues that both approaches are misguided and largely unhelpful in answering the questions that matter: What did those people believe then? How does it relate to what these people want to do now? What is our evidencefor our interpretations? Pragmatic inquiry into these questions recommends an approach that questions grand theories, advocates a critical pluralism about religion and ethics that defies disciplinary boundaries in the pursuit of the truth. Rationality, on a pragmatic approach, is about solving particular problems in medias res, thus there is no hard and fast line to be drawn between inquiry and advocacy; both are essential to negotiating day to day life. The upshot is an approach to religionand ethics in which inquiry looks much like the art history of Michael Baxandall and advocacy like the art criticism of Arthur Danto.},

	abstract = {Reading Heidegger’s Being and Time and Merleau-Ponty’s Phenomenology of Perception suggested that Symbolic {AI} with its representations of meaningless facts about the world could not solve the frame problem, and that the best representation of the world is the world itself. Now {GOFAI} has failed, and Rondey Brooks boasts that his animats avoid the frame problem precisely by directly relating to the world. But Brook’s animates and all other versions of what some call Heideggerian {AI} have their own version of the frame problem, viz. that the program can’t update relevance. Fortunately, there is at least one model of how the brain could provide the causal basis of such an ability. Walter Freeman, a founding figure in neurodynamics and one of the first to take seriously the idea of the brain as a nonlinear dynamical system, has worked out an account of how the brain of an active animal can directly pick up and update what counts as significant in its world. But, to program Heideggerian {AI}, we would not only need a model of brain functioning such as Freeman’s; we would also need a model of our particular way of being embedded and embodied such that what we experience is significant for us in the particular way that it is. This shows the task of a Heideggerian {AI} to be overwhelmingly difficult and casts doubt on whether we will ever be able to accomplish it.},

	abstract = {Most people working on linguistic meaning or communication assume that semantics and pragmatics are distinct domains, yet there is still little consensus on how the distinction is to be drawn. The position defended in this paper is that the semantics/pragmatics distinction holds between (context-invariant) encoded linguistic meaning and speaker meaning. Two other 'minimalist' positions on semantics are explored and found wanting: Kent Bach's view that there is a narrow semantic notion of context which is responsible for providing semantic values for a small number of indexicals, and Herman Cappelen and Ernie Lepore's view that semantics includes the provision of values for all indexicals, even though these depend on the speaker's communicative intentions. Finally, some implications are considered for the favoured semantics/pragmatics distinction of the fact that there are linguistic elements (lexical and syntactic) which do not contribute to truth-conditional content but rather provide guidance on pragmatic inference.},
