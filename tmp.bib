abstract = {In this chapter we conduct a systematic investigation to evaluate alternative methods of conducting cognitive interviews. We begin with a review of the literature pertaining to the cognitive interviewing method. Next, we discuss the research objectives of our experiment. Then we describe the research methods, including the three experimental treatments and supplemental data collection. Finally, we present the research results, followed by a discussion of the implications of the research and a concluding section.},
