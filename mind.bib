                  outside the mind.  Others are impressed by argument
                  suggesting that the meaning of our words `just
                  ain't in the head', and hold that this externalism
                  about meaning carries over into an externalism about
                  mind.  We propose to pursue a third position. We
                  advocate a very different sort of externalism: an
                  \textit{active externalism}, based on the active

                  processes.}

Kohler (Integrative Psychology \& Behavioral Science 44:39-57, 2010) correctly pointed out the serious problems of the machine paradigm, and proposed the "organic" view as a new paradigm. But the term "organic" signifying the processes inside the body, is inadequate to express the characteristic of human mind. The recent philosophy of mind suggests that the mind is realized neither only in the brain nor only in the body, but in the whole system of brain-body-environment, namely, in the "extended mind". The characteristic of human mind resides in the interaction with the mediating tools, artifacts, and the humanized environment. We should propose an "extended mind approach" or an "ecological approach to humanized environment" as a new paradigm for a psychology.},

	abstract = {Existential phenomenologists hold that the two most basic forms of intelligent behavior, learning, and skillful action, can be described and explained without recourse to mind or brain representations. This claim is expressed in two central notions in Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology of Perception : the intentional arc and the tendency to achieve a maximal grip . The intentional arc names the tight connection between body and world, such that, as the active body acquires skills, those skills are “stored”, not as representations in the mind, but as dispositions to respond to the solicitations of situations in the world. A phenomenology of skill acquisition confirms that, as one acquires expertise, the acquired know-how is experienced as finer and finer discriminations of situations paired with the appropriate response to each. Maximal grip names the body's tendency to refine its responses so as to bring the current situation closer to an optimal gestalt. Thus, successful learning and action do not require propositional mental representations. They do not require semantically interpretable brain representations either.},

	abstract = {Connectionism and classicism, it generally appears, have at least this much in common: both place some notion of internal representation at the heart of a scientific study of mind. In recent years, however, a much more radical view has gained increasing popularity. This view calls into question the commitment to internal representation itself. More strikingly still, this new wave of anti-representationalism is rooted not in 'armchair' theorizing but in practical attempts to model and understand intelligent, adaptive behavior. In this paper we first present, and then critically assess, a variety of recent anti-representationalist treatments. We suggest that so far, at least, the sceptical rhetoric outpaces both evidence and argument. Some probable causes of this premature scepticism are isolated. Nonetheless, the anti-representationalist challenge is shown to be both important and progressive insofar as it forces us to see beyond the bare representational/non-representational dichotomy and to recognize instead a rich continuum of degrees and types of representationality.},

But Brook’s animates and all other versions of what some call Heideggerian {AI} have their own version of the frame problem, viz. that the program can’t update relevance. Fortunately, there is at least one model of how the brain could provide the causal basis of such an ability. Walter Freeman, a founding figure in neurodynamics and one of the first to take seriously the idea of the brain as a nonlinear dynamical system, has worked out an account of how the brain of an active animal can directly pick up and update what counts as significant in its world. But, to program Heideggerian {AI}, we would not only need a model of brain functioning such as Freeman’s; we would also need a model of our particular way of being embedded and embodied such that what we experience is significant for us in the particular way that it is. This shows the task of a Heideggerian {AI} to be overwhelmingly difficult and casts doubt on whether we will ever be able to accomplish it.},

         Can human subjects be constructed and yet ethical? If it is language that speaks, rather than the author, how can we claim authorship over our utterances and actions? In this article, I struggle with these questions and try to develop a view of the ethical subject between an essentialist position that pictures the subject as unitary, and a postmodern position depicting the subject as fragmented. On this middle ground, I argue that a viable view of the ethical subject presents it as fundamentally an accountable reason giver, but I also point to some important limitations concerning accountability. Drawing in particular on the recent works of Sabina Lovibond and Judith Butler, I explore the resources for thinking of the subject within what has been called the practical reason approach to ethics, arguing that a subject should be thought of as existing in a normative space – a ‘space of reasons’.},

	abstract = {There are problems in applying the methodology of the natural sciences to problems in                 psychology. This has led to a rethinking of psychology as the study of discursive                 practices, including the semantics of working vocabularies and the rules governing                 orderly thought and action. This has an affinity with analytical philosophy. At the                 same time it suggests a reinterpretation of older psychological research.                 First-order experiments study psychological phenomena, but second-order experiments,                 now very common, study how people describe imaginary situations, and their reactions                 to them, so that it is essentially a study of discursive practices.                 Wittgenstein’s use of the word ‘grammar’ suggests a                 convenient term for clusters of working rules. Philosophers have identified similar                 clusters of propositions, as a priori but synthetic propositions, expressing                 principles of order imposed on raw material by human beings. Psychologists have                 identified contingent universals which have such an ordering function. The                 revelation of the historical and cultural variability of such grammars opens up the                 possibility of richer self-understanding and of the repatterning of life systems.},

This paper explores some central themes and commitments that inhere in these approaches, particularly with regard to how subjectivity is historically and relationally constituted. It emphasizes the importance of further legitimizing them within psychology and adjacent disciplines.

This view is fragmented and incomplete, especially because it fails to take into account both evidence of the value implications of score meaning as a basis for action and the social consequences of score use. The new unified concept of validity interrelates these issues as fundamental aspects of a more comprehensive theory of construct validity that addresses both score meaning and social values in test interpretation and test use. That is, unified validity integrates considerations of content, criteria, and consequences into a construct framework for the empirical testing of rational hypotheses about score meaning and theoretically relevant relationships, including those of an applied and a scientific nature. Six distinguishable aspects of construct validity are highlighted as a means of addressing central issues implicit in the notion of validity as a unified concept. These are content, substantive, structural, generalizability, external , and consequential aspects of construct validity. In effect, these six aspects function as general validity criteria or standards for all educational and psychological measurement, including performance assessments, which are discussed in some detail because of their increasing emphasis in educational and employment settings.

	abstract = {Most people working on linguistic meaning or communication assume that semantics and pragmatics are distinct domains, yet there is still little consensus on how the distinction is to be drawn. The position defended in this paper is that the semantics/pragmatics distinction holds between (context-invariant) encoded linguistic meaning and speaker meaning. Two other 'minimalist' positions on semantics are explored and found wanting: Kent Bach's view that there is a narrow semantic notion of context which is responsible for providing semantic values for a small number of indexicals, and Herman Cappelen and Ernie Lepore's view that semantics includes the provision of values for all indexicals, even though these depend on the speaker's communicative intentions. Finally, some implications are considered for the favoured semantics/pragmatics distinction of the fact that there are linguistic elements (lexical and syntactic) which do not contribute to truth-conditional content but rather provide guidance on pragmatic inference.},
